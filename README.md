Detecting Phishing Websites is to predict whether the website is phishing or legitimate. It is done by using various machine learning algorithms. For this project the algorithm used is Random Forest Classifier.

Working of Algorithm

At first,consider the dataset and preprocess the data. Now,split the data into two terms train data and test data. Build Random Forest Classifier Model,After that the model which is built is trained with the train data and it is tested with test data.Test data doesnot contain class label and at last the model gives the accuracy.
